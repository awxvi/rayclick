### Setup

<br>

It is **STRONGLY** recommened you use [w64DevKit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit). 

<br>

First you need to compile raylib and place the libraylib.a into a directory called "lib/" (in the same scope as include/)

<br>

then you can run

    make

from your w64DevKit terminal or your regular terminal if you have linux.

<br>

if you don't have w64DevKit you can try
    
    mingw32-make

on windows although i'm not sure if it would compile.
